Coinbase API for .NET

This library is currently in alpha stage.
At the moment, only basic read operations
are supported.

Code is split into their respective sub-apis
as defined on the coinbase API documentation
website.

Use at your own risk.

----------------------
Basic usage examples can be found in the test
folder (Currently ./Coinbase.Net.Tests/*.cs)
An appropriate API key must be entered in the
test folder's app.config for it to work properly.
